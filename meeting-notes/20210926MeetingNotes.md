Idea of streaming of private video, from the smart device app, to explicitely selected registered app users, by the recording user. This will offload burden from the backend services. (Recorder and player functionality of the app are symmetric and complimentary, meaning the player can consume streaming by the recording)
Public videos are recorded anonymously, which can be claimed by a user by providing key information (ACR, etc.). Once a public video is claimed successfully by a user, it is does not remain anonymous any longer.
Public videos can be viewed by the following users:
  User who successfully claimed ownership of the video
  Government/legal authority representative users after explicitly making request/demand to us for searching, querying public videos to view them
  Users explicitly given reference/URL by the user who has claimed the ownership or the user who is given rights to share such videos by the ownership claimed users directly or through other users who shared URL with him/her.
  Otherwise, no user will ever be able to see these videos.
Public videos (anonymous or not) don't get counted towards any storage quota of any user, as of now.
Most of the time videos will get recorded as private videos, which will get counted towards the storage quota of the owner/creator
Use counters (recording, playing) will be maintained per user per period (day/week/moth)
User can sell rights to his videos through a due legal process. Once a confirmed copy is made by the buyer, the owner will be free to delete it, but can't share it. All video's existing sharing needs to be revoked on its sale. Copying of the video sold will be through download functionality (or a separate copy on our storage)
Each public video's key (Vivek, please correct it) would be saved in blockchain.
The first cut of the product will have and Android app and backend webservice. First cut of the Product's functional scope needs to be formally documented.
Private videos, like claimed public videos, have to be explicitly shared through passing of a URL, giving read access and optionally grant rights, which can be recursively applied to nth level of sharing.
