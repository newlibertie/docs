# Higher Level Overview

Even though Facebook and Twitter have been used for political purposes,
their effectiveness has had serious shortcomings.  Most often the
discussions tend to be shallow, and favor one extreme
view or another and thereby fail to represent the broad spectrum of
political preferences. This flattening of discourse also has the side effect
of silencing voices which may differ from the
prevalent majority opinion because of fear of retribution.

As many have observed, this flattening and silencing of discourse
also influences our offline behavior.  And this is dangerous for a democracy.

Our approach is to solve this problem by calculating and exposing the
popularity statistics of political positions in a privacy preserving manner.
This shall be done with a web-portal for reporting, and with accompanying
Facebook and Twitter apps that transparently plug into the political discussions
occurring on these platforms.

In order to maintain a high level of trustworthiness, the portal and
apps shall be open-sourced enabling public inspection and
contribution.  Likewise, in order to guard against propaganda, advertising
based revenue has to be replaced with other revenue streams.

As we build this platform we shall post updates and links on this page.  Please
follow and share, and please do provide thoughts, inputs and advice.
